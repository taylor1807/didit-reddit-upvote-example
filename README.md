in this project, deployment was pretty straightforward, i did have to watch the video a couple of times to make sure i did it correctly, but it worked afterwards.

i managed to create metaData to display the title of the post in the tab dynamically, the handling of error when voting when not logged was completed 2 ways depending on which way prefered, i have a error.jsx page, also if you would prefer i have commented out in vote.jsx to conditionly render wether the user is logged in or not.

i also spotted a couple of other errors which i have sorted, the img tag in commentList.jsx should of been Image instead as it was being imported in and not used. also i found a section of commented out code which was moved to a component so i removed it as it was no longer needed.

i did start to look at TipTap as it looked straightforward enough but time escaped me so it has been installed and not used.

## Upvote

Upvote is a Reddit-esque web application that allows users to create posts, upvote and downvote posts, and comment on posts in a multi-threaded, nested list.

The project is built using Next.js with the /app router and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and uses [Auth.js (formerly Next Auth)](https://authjs.dev/) for user authentication. The data is stored in a Postgres database, which is created and accessed with raw SQL queries using the `pg` package.

The project is a work in progress and is not yet complete.

## Setup instructions

1. Fork the repository (check "copy the main branch only") and clone your fork to your local machine
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` - the URL of your Postgres database (eg. the Supabase connection string)
   - `AUTH_SECRET` - the Next Auth secret string (this can be anything at all like a password, but keep it secret!)
   - `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` - the GitHub OAuth client ID (create yours in [Github developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
   - `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` - the GitHub OAuth client secret (create this in [Github developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers))
4. Create the database schema by running the SQL commands in `schema.sql` in your database (eg. by running the commands in Supabase Query Editor)
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site
